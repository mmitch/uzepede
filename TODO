- fix bugs with sped up shots
  - worms should not change direction when encountering a shot, but die instead
  - sometimes a spider can phase though a shot
  - the bug should do the same when jumping into a shut (never stumbled upon that problem but I guess it's there)
- add sounds for bug monster
- release/announce the update on uzebox wiki + forum
  - replace the old version? name this UZEPEDE 2?  what is the norm for other games?
- add bee monster
  - the sprite is already drawn, but what should it do?
- create a rotated version for portrait mode :)
